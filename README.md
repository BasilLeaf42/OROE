# One Ruler on Earth: Total War (OROE:TW)

One Ruler On Earth is a submod for Falcom Total War 3: The Total Conquest, a world map mod for Medieval II: Total War. It features hundreds of new units with completely overhauled models, 9 new factions, balance adjustments, and a new campaign set between 1204 to 1648. Please note that due to the large size of the mod and increased graphical fidelity, the 4GB patch is required for it to run.

This repository is meant to be an online backup in case of hardware failure, as well as to facilitate collaboration among the development team. Public previews and releases can be found on the ModDB page, while the developers can be contacted on Discord.
